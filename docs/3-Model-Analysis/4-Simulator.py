# # Simulator
# If we have a transition system, it might be nice to run a simulation. In this case, we have an MDP that models a hungry lion. Depending on the state it is in, it needs to decide whether it wants to 'rawr' or 'hunt' in order to prevent reaching the state 'dead'.

# %%
from stormvogel import *
lion = examples.create_lion_mdp()
vis = show(lion, layout=Layout("layouts/lion.json"))

# %% [markdown]
# Now, let's run a simulation of the lion! If we do not provide a scheduling function, then the simulator just does a random walk, taking a random choice each time.

# %%
path = simulate_path(lion, steps=5, seed=1234)

# %% [markdown]
# Let's visualize this path in the visualization. Take a look at the model above after executing the next cell.

# %%
vis.highlight_path(path, "red", 1, clear=True)


# %% [markdown]
# We could also provide a scheduling function to choose the actions ourselves. This is somewhat similar to the `bird` API.

# %%
def scheduler(s: State) -> Action:
    return Action.create("rawr")

path2 = stormvogel.simulator.simulate_path(lion, steps=5, seed=1234, scheduler=scheduler)

# %%
vis.highlight_path(path2, "red", 1, clear=True)

# %% [markdown]
# We can also use the scheduler to create a partial model. This model contains all the states that have been discovered by the the simulation.

# %%
partial_model = stormvogel.simulator.simulate(lion, steps=5, scheduler=scheduler, seed=1234)
vis2 = show(partial_model)
