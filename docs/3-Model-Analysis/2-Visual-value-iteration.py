# # Visual value iteration and Markov Chain evolution
# This notebook provides an example of using the stormvogel API for naive value iteration and Markov Chain evolution, and a way to visualize these algorithms.<br>

# %% [markdown]
# ## Value iteration
# This algorithm takes a model and a target state. It then calculates the probability of reaching the target state from all other states iteratively. If a choice has to be made for an action, the action that gives the best result in the previous iteration is chosen. It also takes an additional parameter epsilon, which indicates the target accuracy. A lower value of epsilon gives a more accurate result with more iterations.

# To demonstrate the workings of this algorithm, we use the lion model again.

# %%
lion = examples.create_lion_mdp()
vis = show(lion, layout=Layout("layouts/lion.json"))

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can display the inner workings of a value iteration algorithm: At the beginning we give the target state a value of 1, then we work backwards, always choosing the action that would maximize the value in the previous iteration. In the end, we always end up converging (This was mathematically proven). The brighter the cell is at the end, the higher the chance that we reach the target state from this state.

# Note that naive_value_iteration is also available under `stormvogel.extensions`, in case you would like to use it later. However, this implementation is very inefficient so we recommend using the value iteration algorithms from stormpy if you want good performance.

# An algorithm that is similar to naive value iteration. This time, there is no target state. The algorithm simply applies every probabilistic transition (hence it only works for DTMCs)
